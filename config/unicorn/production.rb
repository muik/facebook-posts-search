  # the following is highly recomended for Rails + "preload_app true"
  # as there's no need for the master process to hold a connection
  #defined?(ActiveRecord::Base) and
  #  ActiveRecord::Base.connection.disconnect!

  # The following is only recommended for memory/DB-constrained
  # installations.  It is not needed if your system can house
  # twice as many worker_processes as you have configured.
  #
  # This allows a new master process to incrementally
  # phase out the old master process with SIGTTOU to avoid a
  # thundering herd (especially in the "preload_app false" case)
  # when doing a transparent upgrade.  The last worker spawned
  # will then kill off the old master process with a SIGQUIT.

  # Throttle the master from forking too quickly by sleeping.  Due
  # to the implementation of standard Unix signal handlers, this
  # helps (but does not completely) prevent identical, repeated signals
  # from being lost when the receiving process is busy.
